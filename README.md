## Description <a name="description"></a>
  
Board Game Cabinet (BGC) is a virtual representation of a userâ€™s collection of physically owned board games. BGC hopes to foster a gaming community that connects players to each other through reviews, discussions and rating, and we hope to introduce users to new board games they would have never found, and to introduce new users to the hobby.<br>
User's of BGC can search for board games, leave and read reviews for them, and claim the board games they own. User's can also reply to reviews to start discussions, and they can view other user's profiles to see the games they own, and the reviews they have left.
